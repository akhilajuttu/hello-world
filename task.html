    <P >
        I have been passionate about hobbies my whole life. I love learning,developing new skills. Some of these skills have proven useful in my career, and some are just for me to enjoy. Today we are gonna talk about the private ones. 
        The ones that make life better and help us decompress at the end of a long day.I always think at the end of the day asking myself what productive i have done today.Most of the times i end up saying nothing and feel depressed.I wait for the right time to come to start new thigs but i relaised that the right time is NOW.So i narrowed my hobbies into 5 differnt super productive things and try to achieve them everyday.Lets see what they are.
